\chapter{How Gender Debiasing Affects Internal Model Representations,
and Why It Matters}\label{chapter:gender_bias_probing}


NEXT PICK UP HERE:
-motivated by previous work.
what is the best way to find a forward arrow of correlation, maybe to start backwards.




Notes:

Talk about how it extends to contextual (and concurrent work that finds the same thing)

Talk about the importance of multiple different metrics and maybe why (though I might not have the experiments to back this up).

Then also talk about what it means about transfer -- we can see what a language model will carry with it to something else. 


Can extend some sections and remove others if not doing by publication. Think about which ones to include.

Say which parts of the work I did since second author. 



Talk about probing as analysis: We can say that it is not a bias measurement but it is another method of analysis that we adapt into a bias measure.
