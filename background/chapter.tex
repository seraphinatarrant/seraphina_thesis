\chapter{Background}\label{chapter:background}
This is a background.

I've tried to start with things that are sufficiently general, and then I figure things that are more specific I will put immediately before each paper, rather than here? But I'll include the specific ones at the end in case you disagree.

\section{What is Fairness}
\subsection{Fairness as Generalisation issues vs. as Stereotyping}
This is really only important for discussing part 2 with my experiments on random seeds, and then as some of the setup for part 3. It is kind of a minor point of both papers, but it is important to me cause I am really into it and it did change my setup for both. But maybe that doesn't belong here?

\section{Measuring Fairness}
\subsection{Desirable characteristics of fairness measurement: types of validity}

\subsection{How fairness can be measured: approaches from different subfields, as well as strengths and weaknesses of each approach} Should be pretty self explanatory. This is important for all of Part 1.

\paragraph{Probing as analysis}
This is also not bias specific but it relevant for both chapter 4 and part 3 so I think it should be up here

\paragraph{Causal interventions for analysis}
This is not bias specific, but is relevant for both parts 2 and 3 so I think it belongs up here


\section{Transfer Learning}
\subsection{transfer learning  cross-lingually}
Obvs only relevant for part 2.
\subsection{fairness in transfer learning}

Note: Can do a subsec "fairness in pretrained models in transfer", "fairness in downstream models in transfer" and then the lack of anything doing both will be helpful motivation



\section{Common Approaches to Debiasing}
This is important for chapters 3 and 4 of part 1. It could also include removing information, which I used in part 3 (as it is a debiasing method) though that type is not used in part 1. 
.

Then: More specific stuff that probably goes later
