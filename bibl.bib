abstract = {The direct effect of one event on another can be defined and measured by holding constant
all intermediate variables between the two. Indirect effects present conceptual and
practical difficulties (in nonlinear models), because they cannot be isolated by holding
certain variables constant. This paper presents a new way of defining the effect transmitted
through a restricted set of paths, without controlling variables on the remaining
paths. This permits the assessment of a more natural type of direct and indirect effects,
one that is applicable in both linear and nonlinear models and that has broader policy-related
interpretations. The paper establishes conditions under which such assessments can
be estimated consistently from experimental and nonexperimental data, and thus extends
path-analytic techniques to nonlinear and nonparametric models.},
